# ‚úàÔ∏è: What Have I learned?

## Using GitHub..... 

*Using GitHub still feels like I am taking shots in the dark.* 

As noted in the syllabus, coding is a different language, so there will be differences in programs geared towards programers. I just need to be persistent until I achieve some level of comfort with it.

# üêô: GitHub

GitHub is a collaborative platform geared towards coding and development. It distinguishes itself from other collaboration programs by allowing people to work simultaneously without mess and confusion. Members of a team can clone a repository and create branches. They can make alterations to the project as they see fit, and request to merge when they finish. The administrator of the Main Branch can either approve or reject these changes. 

*You can also Fork Repositories, but this is only usefull for data storing purposes.*

### GitHub Tracks Changes and Allows for experimentation without risking the final product.

###### What I Have Yet to Understand.

I feel like I understand the fundamentals of GitHub, but the format is still uncomfortable for me. GitHub is a powerful tool, as such, there are so many functions I don't know how to properly utilize yet. For instance, as I am completing this assignment, I am not sure If I am doing it in the right place. 

All of this is to say, I have not gotten into the *GitHub Flow* yet......Also, I don't love that there is no spell check function.
